üß≠This diagram illustrates a virtual Active Directory (AD) lab environment designed to simulate a realistic enterprise network for IT support, cybersecurity, or system administration training.

üè¢ Core Components
Group Policy Object (GPO)

Positioned at the top, this represents centralized configuration management in the Active Directory environment.

GPOs are used to enforce security settings, user permissions, drive mappings, password policies, and more.

GPOs are synchronized with the domain controller to propagate policy settings to client machines.

Domain Controller (dc1.local.lab)

The centerpiece of the AD infrastructure.

Hosts Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and maintains the domain database (accounts, groups, computers, etc.).

Authenticates users and computers using LDAP over TCP port 389.

Receives GPO sync from the Group Policy Management infrastructure.

Performs DNS Zone Lookups via UDP port 53 to locate network resources.

DNS/DHCP Server (dns1.local.lab)

Provides Domain Name System (DNS) services for internal name resolution.

Handles Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically assign IP addresses to clients.

Works closely with the domain controller to ensure domain members can resolve hostnames like dc1.local.lab.

üíª Client Machines
Client VM 1 (client01)

Client VM 2 (client02)

Client VM 3 (client03)

All clients:

Are domain-joined to local.lab.

Authenticate to the domain controller using LDAP (TCP 389).

Receive policies from the domain via GPO enforcement.

Communicate internally with the DC, DNS server, and potentially other AD-integrated services.

üî• Firewall
Sits between the internal lab network and the public internet.

Controls and monitors traffic between client machines and the outside world.

Ensures that unauthorized external access is blocked and only required services (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) are allowed out.

Can simulate enterprise-level security devices like pfSense or Windows Firewall.

‚òÅÔ∏è Internet Access
The bottom of the diagram shows a connection to the Internet, symbolizing external services such as:

GitHub (for pulling scripts or repositories)

Microsoft 365 (for productivity apps or cloud-based directory sync)

This access helps simulate realistic corporate workflows like software updates, cloud access, or remote authentication scenarios.

üîÑ Logical Flow
Client boots ‚Üí requests IP from DHCP

Resolves dc1.local.lab via DNS

Authenticates via LDAP to the Domain Controller

Receives GPOs

Accesses internal or external resources through the Firewall

This lab setup models a minimal yet complete Active Directory infrastructure, making it ideal for practicing:

Domain join procedures

Group policy management

User and group administration

Network security simulation

Windows PowerShell scripting

Threat detection/response in an AD environment
